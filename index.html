                    <p>Hello and Welcome! I was born and raised in sunny Southern California but have called Georgia
                        home for the past twelve years. There's a saying here, "I wasn't born in the South but I got
                        here as soon as I could." I am a wife and mother of three, and have been a stay at home mom
                        since 2011. I love all things pertaining to health and wellness, getting outdoors with the
                        family, and collecting Mexican culture art!
                        I recently decided to move out of the world of chiropractic, although I will always be an
                        advocate of it's benefits, and into the world of web developement. I want to attain the skills
                        to help people create dynamic websites and applications that showcase their company's goals, and
                        missions while making sites that are user friendly. Especially, the young and elderly.</p>
